    In 2000 a Swiss foundation launched a campaign to determine the New Seven Wonders of the world <br> Given that the original Seven Wonders list was compiled in the 2nd century <br> BCE—and that only one entrant is still standing (the Pyramids of Giza)—it seemed time <br> for an update. And people around the world apparently agreed, as more than 100 million <br> votes were cast on the Internet or by text messaging. The final results, which were announced <br> in 2007, were met with cheers as well as some jeers—a number of prominent contenders, such as <br> Athens’s  Acropolis, failed to make the cut.
